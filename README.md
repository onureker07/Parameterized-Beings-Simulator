##Parameterized Being Simulator##
The Parameterized Being Simulator is a Java-based tool for simulating the population dynamics of various species.


#Usage#
The Main class for the simulator is MainMenu.java, which can be executed to start the simulation. To estimate the Lotka-Volterra parameters for a simulation file, the user can use the provided visualization tool implemented in Python.

#Future Works#
The Parameterized Being Simulator has the potential for further development and improvement. Some future works that are being considered include the addition of herbivorous species and the integration of a neuroevolution model.

# Parameterized Being Simulator
The Parameterized Being Simulator is a Java-based tool for simulating the population dynamics of various species.


## Usage
The Main class for the simulator is MainMenu.java, which can be executed to start the simulation. To estimate the Lotka-Volterra parameters and visualization of simulation files, the user can check ResultProcessor folder.

## Future Works
The Parameterized Being Simulator has the potential for further development and improvement. Some future works that are being considered include the addition of herbivorous species and the integration of a neuroevolution model.
